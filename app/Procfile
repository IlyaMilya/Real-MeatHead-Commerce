release: bin/rake db:migrate db:seed

## This will first migrate your tables and seed the pre-made data.
## Then it will run your Rails server for your websites use for the general public.
## My release has db:seed:replant because I have since had to redeploy when making updates but didnâ€™t want to lose the data made by outside users.
